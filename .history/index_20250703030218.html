            <p>I spent nearly 20 years in garment exports. Our typical cycle looked like this: the client shared a theme, say, 10
            styles of Boys' Printed Tees with Denim Shorts across sizes from newborn to toddler. We quote, get the order, build
            sample after sample, embroidery approvals, lab dips, fabric yardage checks, and pre-production approvals. The whole
            process took six months.
            And yet, we were often rushed.
            Because the buyer already knew who they wanted this season's orders from, our tech packs and sketches were constantly
            deprioritized. We were left scrambling, either compressing development or eating into production timelines.
            Over time, I started talking to my buyers' designers. I learned that fashion has too many variables, even with templates
            and digital tools. No one-size-fits-all solution existed.
            But I couldn't shake the feeling: there had tobe a better way.</p>

            <p>I moved on to other manufacturing ventures. Eventually, I
            shifted careers into Artificial Intelligence. Somewhere along
            the way, it clicked, “Maybe now the technology exists to help
            designers!”.
            That was the Eureka moment. What if we built a tool, a Genie
            that assisted designers through the tedious parts, without
            ever taking away their creative control?
            Like any good Genie, it would help bring ideas to life. Not
            magic exactly, just advanced algorithms thatfeel like magic.</p>
