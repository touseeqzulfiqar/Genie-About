            <h3>We’re Still Listening</h3>
            <p>We don’t have all the answers. But we’re building, improving, and listening.</p>

            <h3>Why We Built Design Genie?</h3>
            <p>I moved on to other manufacturing ventures. Eventually, I shifted careers into Artificial Intelligence.
                Somewhere along the way, it clicked, “Maybe now the technology exists to help designers!” That was the
                Eureka moment.</p>
            <p>What if we built a tool, a Genie that assisted designers through the tedious parts, without ever taking
                away their creative control? Like any good Genie, it would help bring ideas to life. Not magic exactly,
                just advanced algorithms that feel like magic.</p>

            <h3>The Humans Behind the Genie</h3>
            <p>That’s when I met my co-founders. Lalit, a trusted industry partner, supplies garment accessories to
                manufacturers and exporters. He consulted his network of designers, their feedback was encouraging, and
                he joined the project.</p>
            <p>Benjamin, a system architect working with AI and also having worked with many fashion brands. When I
                pitched the idea to him, he not only loved it, he proposed something bold: skip the software contract,
                take equity instead. That sealed it. We were building something real.</p>

            <h3>Built With Feedback. Fueled by You.</h3>
            <p>We created early prototypes and took them back to the people we trusted. Then we went wider, anonymous
                users on Reddit, LinkedIn, and beyond. We wanted strangers to tell us if we were building something
                meaningful or just another tool.</p>

            <h3>From Failure to Focus</h3>
            <p>I’ve launched two businesses before. Both failed. Why? Because I thought: “This is a great idea. People
                should want it.” This time, we did it differently. Validation. Feedback. Iteration. Repeat.</p>

            <h3>Your Feedback Fuels Us</h3>
            <p>Drop us a note, a request, a bug, or a wish; we’re listening!</p>
