                I spent nearly 20 years in garment exports. Our typical cycle looked like this: the client shared a theme, say, 10
                styles of Boys' Printed Tees with Denim Shorts across sizes from newborn to toddler. We quote, get the order, build
                sample after sample, embroidery approvals, lab dips, fabric yardage checks, and pre-production approvals. The whole
                process took six months.
                And yet, we were often rushed.
                Because the buyer already knew who they wanted this season's orders from, our tech packs and sketches were constantly
                deprioritized. We were left scrambling, either compressing development or eating into production timelines.
                Over time, I started talking to my buyers' designers. I learned that fashion has too many variables, even with templates
                and digital tools. No one-size-fits-all solution existed.
                But I couldn't shake the feeling: there had to be a better way.

                    I moved on to other manufacturing ventures. Eventually, I
                    shifted careers into Artificial Intelligence. Somewhere along
                    the way, it clicked, “Maybe now the technology exists to help
                    designers!”.
                    That was the Eureka moment. What if we built a tool, a Genie
                    that assisted designers through the tedious parts, without
                    ever taking away their creative control?
                    Like any good Genie, it would help bring ideas to life. Not
                    magic exactly, just advanced algorithms that feel like magic.

                    I floated the idea to people I trusted, industry peers,
                    manufacturers, and software folks. They liked it. But I didn’t stop
                    there. I showed them similar tools already in the market and asked,
                    “Are these solving your problems?”
                    Their feedback confirmed what I suspected: something was
                    missing.
                    So I set out to build it, with a few key principles in mind:
                    The Genie would handle the routine, while you stay focused on
                    what truly matters.
                    It would adapt to your workflow, not the other way around.
                    You could step in at any point and use only what you need. No
                    rigid paths. No lock-ins.
