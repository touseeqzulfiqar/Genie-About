                I spent nearly 20 years in garment exports. Our typical cycle looked like this: the client shared a theme, say, 10
                styles of Boys' Printed Tees with Denim Shorts across sizes from newborn to toddler. We quote, get the order, build
                sample after sample, embroidery approvals, lab dips, fabric yardage checks, and pre-production approvals. The whole
                process took six months.
                And yet, we were often rushed.
                Because the buyer already knew who they wanted this season's orders from, our tech packs and sketches were constantly
                deprioritized. We were left scrambling, either compressing development or eating into production timelines.
                Over time, I started talking to my buyers' designers. I learned that fashion has too many variables, even with templates
                and digital tools. No one-size-fits-all solution existed.
                But I couldn't shake the feeling: there had to be a better way.
